# aTox

[Tox](https://github.com/irungentoo/toxcore) plugin for atom.

This plugin will allow users to open up and/or join project specific chatrooms in a fashion similar to developer IRC channels. It will also implement an efficient way of sharing and editing content with other aTox users of the same project through the use of [collabedit](http://collabedit.com/)(presumably).

Additional features will, among others, include the ability to have chatrooms be notified of push-events of the project or being able of marking lines of code for other project users (on the same commit).
